# Famish

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view recipes they want to cook and plan shopping trips around them.


## Set Up
1. Fork [this](https://github.com/dstavis/whats-cookin) repository and [this](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/whats-cookin-api)
2. Clone both of the repositories to your local machine
3. `cd` into the repository
5.  Once in the repository, run `npm install`
6.  After installation, run `npm start`
7. Repeat steps 5 & 6 for the other repository
8.  A live server should now be available at `http://localhost:8080/`, paste this address into your browser

(If you see the error message prompting you to run "npm audit fix --force" do NOT run this.)
